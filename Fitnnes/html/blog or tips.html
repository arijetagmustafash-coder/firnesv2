        <h2>Top 5 Warm-Up Exercises Before Training</h2>
        <p class="date">Posted on January 18, 2026</p>
        <p>
          Warming up is essential before any workout. Here are 5 must-do
          exercises: jumping jacks, arm circles, leg swings, dynamic stretches,
          and light cardio. A proper warm-up increases blood flow and reduces
          injury risk.

        <h2>Martial Arts for Beginners: Which Style Should You Choose?</h2>
        <p class="date">Posted on January 18, 2026</p>
        <p>
          Choosing your first martial art can be overwhelming. Consider Karate
          for discipline, Taekwondo for kicks, BJJ for grappling, or Muay Thai
          for overall combat skills. Try a few classes to see what resonates
          with you.

        <h2>Building Muscle: The Importance of Progressive Overload</h2>
        <p class="date">Posted on January 18,2026</p>
        <p>
          Progressive overload is key to muscle growth. Gradually increase
          weight, reps, or intensity in your workouts. This constant challenge
          forces your muscles to adapt and grow stronger over time.

        <h2>Recovery Tips for Athletes</h2>
        <p class="date">Posted on January 18, 2026</p>
        <p>
          Recovery is just as important as training. Get 7-9 hours of sleep,
          stay hydrated, eat protein-rich foods, and consider stretching or foam
          rolling. Rest days allow your body to repair and strengthen.
